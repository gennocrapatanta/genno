          <h3>Hi I' am Genno C. Crapatanta born on a warm, sunny day in December 19, 2004 in Liloy Zamboanga del Norte. I still live in Liloy,  and I go to school at JRMSU-TC. Life to me means friends and family who you can trust and who trusts you. I am pretty much on the happy side of life, but like all teens I do I have my "days of." That means I do have some sad days or depressed days. I have a few friends here that sort of look out for me and when I am having a bad day, I have someone here at school to talk to. I make my school days go by thinking of either the next hour or what I will do when I get home or on the weekend.  </h3>

                <h3>The year 2023 will make one year since I graduated from high school. I think I will probably be still living here in Liloy. Life is a rollercoaster, and this chapter delves into the ups and downs I encountered along the way. From personal setbacks to professional challenges, I share the lessons I learned and the resilience that emerged from facing adversity. It is a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the power of perseverance. </h3>

My journey continues, and I am excited to embrace the unknown, chase new dreams, and make a positive difference in the world. This is my story, a testament to the power of dreams and the beauty of embracing life's adventures. </h3>
